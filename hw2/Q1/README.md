# Instruction
## TO-DO
Design a table, a grouped bar chart, and a stacked bar chart with filters. The data for this question is hosted online and will help you practice connecting Tableau to online data sources.

## Motivation
We want to help a board game design company analyze the current popular board game data from the website BoardGameGeek. Create a single well-designed table to visualize the data contained in popular_board_game.csv.

The company is interested in grouping popular games into “support solo” (minimum player = 1) and
“not support solo” (minimum player > 1), because single-player games require a different design strategy.
