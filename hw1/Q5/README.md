## Installation

Get started by installing Flask on your machine by running 
```bash
pip install Flask
```

To run the code, you must navigate to the Q5 folder in your terminal/command prompt and execute the following command: 
```bash
python run.py.
```

After running the command go to http://127.0.0.1:3001/ on your browser. This will open up index.html showing a table in which the rows returned by data_wrangling() are displayed.
